OFF-TARGET AMPLIFICATION

Significant off-target amplification detected: 14% of reads are not CARLIN.

REFERENCE_LIST

Collapsing MiSeq cell barcodes against the platform's reference list may lead to more FPs and FNs.

FILTERING

Sequencing depth insufficent. Low number of reads detected in FASTQ.

ANALYSIS

Only 1% of common CBs could successfully call an allele. Only 17% of reads in callable CBs folded into consensus for allele. This suggests an issue with library preparation, such as low primer specificity or cross-talk during amplification.

RESULTS

Template allele never reported by any CB. This is likely because difficulty in establishing allele-calling consensus for many CBs penalizes longer sequences
