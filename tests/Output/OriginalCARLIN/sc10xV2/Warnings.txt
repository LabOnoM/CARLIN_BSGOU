OFF-TARGET AMPLIFICATION

Significant off-target amplification detected: 10% of reads are not CARLIN.

REFERENCE_LIST

Collapsing MiSeq cell barcodes against the platform's reference list may lead to more FPs and FNs.

FILTERING

Sequencing depth insufficent. Low number of reads detected in FASTQ.

ANALYSIS

Preferential amplification of edited alleles detected. (Reads per edited CB / reads per unedited CB) > 2.

Number of common CBs is low (376). This is likely due to:
 - reads dedicated to FP CBs owing to the inflated reference list used
 - low sequencing depth so that many CBs do not exceed the required threshold
 - preferential amplification of edited transcripts causing many reads to be allocated to a few CBs

Only 60% of reads in callable CBs folded into consensus for allele. This suggests an issue with library preparation, such as low primer specificity or cross-talk during amplification.

RESULTS

Low +Dox induction detected. Only 13% of CBs reported an edited CARLIN allele.
